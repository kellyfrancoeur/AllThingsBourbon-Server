We live to add our own touch and ask if there’s a better way. As we tinkered, tested and tasted, we discovered that making beer was more art than science. And while we respect and honor tradition, we relish the opportunity to take it further. That freedom has allowed us to reinterpret brewing. And along the way help to reinvigorate the industry. From bringing a hoppy twist to a porter, or developing a proprietary yeast for our amber ale, to creating a breakthrough gold medal-winning IPA. We couldn’t stop with just beer, so we got into the distilling business—to see if we could add our own spin to another centuries-old craft. But all of this would be wasted if we couldn’t share it. Whether serving up new flavors, collaborating with seasoned brewmasters, or training the next generation at Home Brew Mart, we not only want to challenge our own tastes, but expand yours.

All of our spirits are made in copper stills unlike many larger spirit manufacturers. The copper acts on the mash to create a clean, smooth finish. All of our stills were custom made to founder, Stuart Hobson's, design. A family owned business in Germany that has been making stills for over 150 years built them all. Heartland Distillers' strives to maintain the highest standard of quality with our spirits. Using the batch distillation method, we always remove the first part of the batch. Many large spirit producers leave this in jeopardizing the integrity of their product. Our standard of quality doesn't end at the end of production. We also hand bottle and hand label every spirit that leaves our distillery. This dedication to excellent spirits separates us from our competitors.",

Colorado Gold Spirits are distilled using an Arnold Holstein Batch Reflux Still. Arnold Holstein, located in Germany, has been making high quality stills for 50 years. The beautiful copper used in the still is not just to make it look impressive. The copper actually contributes to the smoothness of our spirits by removing impurities. Don't let the large size of the still deceive you. We are in every way a craft distillery. Painstaking effort and skill go into making our spirits one small batch at a time. We meticulously control the quality of each batch to assure that you get the finest spirits we can offer.",

Keeping with the local and even hyper-local spirit, we’ve added some great micro brews and hard ciders from our neighbors to enhance your experience. To fully round out your experience here at Flats, we set root in this raw, rustic old sawmill building. With almost a century removed, charred old growth hardwood interior, we’ve kept as much as possible original, producing a unique space that appears as it did decades ago, only a little more refined.",

Nestled in the quiet Kentucky countryside near Lawrenceburg, and on the banks of the scenic Salt River, the Four Roses Distillery makes the trip to this very mellow place all that more rewarding. The Four Roses Distillery was built in 1910 and features a unique Spanish Mission-Style architecture rarely seen in Kentucky. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and operates continuously, except for the summer months. In 2012, the Four Roses Distillery Visitor Center underwent a significant renovation. The remodeled, 5,000-square-foot visitor center and gift shop was part of an extended expansion on the distillery property. The Distillery Visitor Center showcases antique bottles, vintage advertising and other memorabilia, along with displays of equipment and ingredients that illustrate the distilling process. The center also includes two Bourbon tasting bars, where guests can sample Four Roses Bourbon, and take home a souvenir glass, following a distillery tour.",

Even the whiskey experts are beginning to take notice. In his 2014 Whisky Bible, Jim Murray -- one of the most respected tasters in the industry – named our Cowboy Bourbon “American Micro Whisky of the Year” and he gave it a 96 score! Garrison Brothers Texas Straight Bourbon Whiskey is bold, proud and authentic. It's home-grown and handcrafted from the finest ingredients. Plump, organic yellow corn from the Texas Panhandle. Premium organic winter wheat that we grow ourselves here on the ranch and two-row barley from the Pacific Northwest and Canada.",

With abundant high quality grain, local craft spirits flourished and over 1000 farm distilleries produced Whiskey and Gin reflecting the unique terroir of the region. In the 1930’s, Prohibition forced these distilleries to shut their doors and this wellspring of American spirits was left dry. Hillrock Estate Distillery is changing this. Our mission is to produce the finest hand-crafted spirits made with our own grain, floor malted, craft distilled in our copper pot still, aged in fine oak and hand bottled at our estate in the Hudson Valley Highlands. Crowned by a fine 1806 Georgian house built by a successful grain merchant and Revolutionary War Captain and meticulously restored to its original beauty, Hillrock Distillery overlooks our rolling barley fields and the distant Berkshire Mountains. Like our premier spirits, every detail refined, no expense spared, quality steeped in the tradition of 200 years of rich history.",

Founded in 2010 by Colin Spoelman and David Haskell, we make handmade moonshine and bourbon out of the 115-year-old Paymaster Building in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. We use New York grain and traditional distilling equipment to make distinctive whiskey. Our moonshine and bourbon have both won “Best in Category” from the American Distilling Institute’s Craft Spirits Awards and our bourbon won two silver medals from the inaugural American Craft Distillers Association Awards in 2014. We only distill whiskey for our label and we never buy bulk whiskey from any other source. First located in a 325 square-foot room in East Williamsburg, Kings County began as the smallest commercial distillery in the country, with five 24-liter stainless steel stills making whiskey seven days a week, 16 hours a day. In 2012, we moved into the Paymaster Building in the historic Brooklyn Navy Yard, just steps from legendary site of the Brooklyn Whiskey Wars of the 1860s and the former distillery district of the waterfront. The distillery was built to exact specifications: Our copper gooseneck whiskey stills were fabricated in Scotland; our wooden fermenters were built locally by Isseks Brothers, a firm responsible for many of the rooftop water tanks around New York. The distillery grows corn and barley at a small farm onsite, and spent grain is recycled as compost and pig feed.",

What started as a crazy idea, grew into an opportunity to create something that these parts hadn't seen since prohibition. A chance to create truly home grown, handmade spirits. If you appreciate the fine quality that only comes from the freshest ingredients... If you believe in honest hard work and the integrity of the family farm... If you know that a commitment to quality takes some extra time... If you're looking to experience pleasure far beyond taste in the bottom of your glass... You've come to the right place. We're a family owned and operated company. We believe in stewardship of our land and water. We know that the family farm is an important part of our community and our culture here. And we believe in quality above all else. We hope you'll appreciate the hard work that each hand signed bottle represents. We hope you'll share some with your friends, then come to LeClaire and say hello so we can show you what makes us so proud about the wonderful place we call home.",

The creation of the unique blends and recipes wasn't possible with without our master distiller creating his own copper still - all by hand. Once the still was in place, our distiller began perfecting an old family recipe for moonshine. The result is Mystic Mountain Distillery's 'Rocky Mountain Moonshine Sippin' Hooch' and its success has led to creating exciting new recipes for several Vodkas, a Gin and now an award winning American Blended Bourbon Whiskey - Ace's High Bourbon Whiskey.",

But when they set out to resurrect Nelson's Green Brier Distillery, founded in the 1800s by their great-great-great grandfather Charles Nelson, the boys realized their kinship ran deeper than blood. They both had spirit pulsing through their veins. So in their mere 20s, the Nelson brothers have set on a grand journey—not just to make and sell whiskey—but to rebuild a business that helped bring the term 'Tennessee Whiskey' to America and Europe. Through researching, seeking capital, crafting brands from Charles Nelson's original recipes and putting bottles of their small-batch bourbon on shelves, they are the essence of the American dream and spirit.",

His grandfather, who was known as 'Pappy', started the family in the business back in the 1870s when he was a salesman for the W.L. Weller & Sons liquor wholesalers in Louisville. He later built and was president of the Stitzel-Weller Distillery in Louisville, which opened its doors on Derby day, 1935. Their prominent brands were W.L.Weller, Rebel Yell, Cabin Still and Old Fitzgerald bourbons. Julian's father, Julian, Jr., operated the distillery until the family sold it in 1972. At that time Julian, Jr. started the Old Rip Van Winkle brand with some of the whiskey he made while he was at Stitzel-Weller. Julian joined his dad in 1977. Julian continued to operate the business after his father's death in 1981. Julian now has his whiskey produced for him under his grandfather's original wheated bourbon recipe, and ages and bottles the Old Rip Van Winkle brands in Frankfort, Kentucky. His whiskeys are the highest rated whiskeys available. The 20-year old 'Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve' has received a rating of 99 by the Wine Enthusiast magazine. His 13-year old rye whiskey was the first premium aged rye whiskey. In 2001 Julian's son Preston joined the business with his dad. He is the fourth Van Winkle to sell these premium bourbon and rye whiskeys.",
