To ensure consistency, we rotate every barrel by hand and age our bourbon to taste, not time. Each and every bottle of Maker's® is still hand-dipped in our signature red wax at our distillery in Loretto, Ky., just like Bill, Sr., would have wanted.",

Ten seared French oak staves are fitted into the barrel before the whisky is finished to maturity under ideal conditions in our limestone cellar. The result is an easy-to-sip bourbon with notes of caramel, vanilla and baking spice that greet the palate in layers. Capturing the 46 taste vision took some doing. But all you need to figure out is your favorite way to enjoy Bill, Jr.’s recipe.",
